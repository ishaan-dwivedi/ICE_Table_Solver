# Development

- **4/30/20** Added functionality to solve a simple Ice Table
    problem. Also created an IceSolver class that aids in solving
    an Ice Table. 
---
- **4/27/20** Tried creating a struct to better handle input
    from ImGui. Did not work well, decided to focus on the
    actual solving and be able to solve an Ice Table problem.
    Will get back to the GUI input later.
---
- **4/23/20** Able to use the ImGui cinder block, but 
    the InputText method is not taking in and storing input.
---
- **4/21/20** Setup Cinder-ImGui cinder block
---
- **4/19/20** Downloaded project
