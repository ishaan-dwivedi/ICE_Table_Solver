# Development

- **4/30/20** Added functionality to solve a simple Ice Table
    problem. Also created an IceSolver class that aids in solving
    an Ice Table. Several helper functions are in the IceSolver
    class that help solve these problems such as SolveQuadratic()
    and ParseConcentrations(); 
    
    Need to complete the following:
    
    [ X ] - Solve simple Ice Table
    
    [ ] - Be able to solve more complex Ice Tables
    
    [ ] - Use and fill out helper functions that aid in solving
          complex Ice Tables.
          
    [ ] - Try to fix input from GUI, if not just output a solved
          Ice Table.

- **4/28/20** Added documentation throughout the project
    to make code more comprehensible. 
---
- **4/27/20** Tried creating a struct to better handle input
    from ImGui. Did not work, decided to focus on the
    actual solving and be able to solve an Ice Table problem.
    Will get back to the GUI input later. May just take input
    from a file and output via the GUI.

- **4/23/20** Able to use the ImGui cinder block, but 
    the InputText method is not taking in and storing input.
---
- **4/21/20** Setup Cinder-ImGui cinder block
---
- **4/19/20** Downloaded project
