# [Chemistry ICE Table Solver]

Author: [Ishaan Dwivedi]

I want to create an application that reads several types of ICE
table problems and outputs a solved problem with all the right
concentrations. An ICE table is a common method to solve Acid -
Base, Equilibrium, and other various chemistry problems when
wanting to find a specific concentration of a species after 
another chemical species has been added at equilibrium. ICE 
stands for initial, change, equilibrium.

I am a CS + Chemistry major and have been doing Ice Tables
throughout the year. Sometimes doing them can be tedious
calculations that could have easily been automated. Instead of
manually setting up an ICE table and then using the quadratic
formula to get the change in concentration, I would rather be
able to just in input the initial concentrations and see what
the final concentrations would be at equilibrium.

The library that I am going to use is a cinder block
[Cinder-ImGui](https://github.com/simongeilfus/Cinder-ImGui)
to help input as well as output solved ICE table problems.
The user can input given concentrations using a GUI and the 
application will output a GUI with solved concentrations.
 
* Week 1 - Be able to solve simple equilibrium Ice table
* Week 2 - Be able to solve simple acid base Ice tables
* Week 3 - Be able to solve harder, complex acid base ice tables
such as buffers. 

If I were to finish early, some stretch goals would be to 
have a GUI that directly takes in equations and concentrations
and outputs the solved answer. The GUI could also solve different
types of ICE table problems.
